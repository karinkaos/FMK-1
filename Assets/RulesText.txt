2–4 players move their pieces clockwise along the board according to the number rolled on the dice.

Be the first player to move your pieces from the starting area, around the board and into the center.
 
Each player has four pieces of a unique color, starting in their respective nests.

The board is a square with a cross-shaped path.

Players take turns rolling a six-sided dice. To move a piece out of the nest and onto the starting spot, a player must roll a 1 or a 6.
If a 6 is rolled, the player can either:
Move a piece out of the nest. Or move a piece that is already on the board.
Rolling a 6 also grants the player an extra roll.

Knocking Out:
If a player's piece lands on a spot occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is knocked back to its starting nest. The knocked player must roll a 1 or 6 again to bring the piece back onto the board.

Safe Zones on the board are marked by colored spots of each color, where pieces cannot be knocked out.
Each player has safe zones in their starting spot and home column.

Home Column: Once a piece has made a full round on the board, it enters the home column and can start their way into the center where it must land by an exact roll on the dice.

Once it reaches the center it disappears from the board.
